1.2 Sketching a regression model and data: Figure 1.1b shows data corresponding to the fitted line 洧녽 = 46.3 + 3.0洧논 with residual standard deviation 3.9, and values of 洧논 ranging roughly from 0 to 4%.

(a) Sketch hypothetical data with the same range of 洧논 but corresponding to the line 洧녽 = 30 + 10洧논 with residual standard deviation 3.9.

```{r}

```

(b) Sketch hypothetical data with the same range of 洧논 but corresponding to the line 洧녽 = 30 + 10洧논 with residual standard deviation 10.

```{r}
a <- rnorm(1000, mean = 2, sd=2/3)
hist(a)

b <- rnorm(1000, sd=3.9)

lm()
```
